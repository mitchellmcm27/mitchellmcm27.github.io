I graduated with a B.Sc. in Geology from the University of Alabama, and I recently received my M.Sc. in Environmental Science from the University of West Florida. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in tectonic geomorphology at the University of Toronto ([advisor Lindsay Schoenbohm](www.lindsay-schoenbohm.com).

For my M.Sc. thesis, I investigated the physical and environmental controls on streambank erosion in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico Coastal Plain through an extensive field and modeling effort to answer the question, can we predict with any confidence how much a given streambank will erode over time, and thus how much sediment it will yield (at least in the Gulf Coastal plain)? I combined remotely sensed tree biomass data, a global land-surface model, and a state of the art hydrodynamic model to develop a reasonably accurate model for streambank erosion. This work culminated in the publication of three manuscripts.

For my Ph.D., I'm looking at the role that lithosphere removal has played in the central Andes. The lithosphere is the relatively cold, rigid part of the earth's mantle and crust. It turns out that, under certain conditions, pieces of the lithosphere can become unstable and "drip off" into the mantle below, with significant consequences to the earth's surface (basin formation and volcanism). The importance of this process is still debated and is likely to vary from place to place.

I started an app development company to develop a VR locomotion solution (iPhone/Anroid and Windows apps), which released in December 2016. If you have VR system for Windows, give it a try. Our current project, Mixel, is a cocktail recipe app that filters the recipes based on the ingredients you actually own, and is available for iPhone and Android.

Please contact me for more information on any of this, or check out my CV.
